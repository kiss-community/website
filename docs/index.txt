OVERVIEW
________________________________________________________________________________


* STATIC PACKAGING SYSTEM

  The package format is entirely static. A series of plain-text files with
  fields separated by lines and spaces. Easily parseable via any programming
  language or with basic UNIX utilities.

  More information: @/package-system $/kiss-community/repo


* PORTABLE PACKAGE MANAGER

  The package manager is written in less than 1000 lines of POSIX shell with
  a large emphasis on portability. The only requirements are a POSIX compliant
  environment, curl and git.

  More information: @/package-manager $/kiss-community/kiss


* BUS FACTOR OF ZERO

  The distribution is designed to be maintainable by a single person. There is
  no infrastructure and the entire distribution is merely a few Git
  repositories. The distribution's upstream is entirely optional.

  More information: @/faq#4.0 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor


* LESS SOFTWARE

  Less software is better than more software. As the amount of running software
  increases, as does the risk of bugs, security issues and things going awry.
  A system with less moving parts is also far easier to wholly understand.

  More information: @/software


* USER CHOICE

  There is no lock-in to specific software. The user has the ability to mix and
  match any shell, core utilities, init system, device manager and more. The
  alternatives system enables this down to file level.
